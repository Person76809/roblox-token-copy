Copie your roblox token

In order to retrieve your own Roblox token, you would need to log in to your account on the Roblox website and inspect the network traffic using your browser's developer tools. Once you have logged in, you should see a network request to https://auth.roblox.com/v2/login with a POST method. In the request headers, you should see a field called X-CSRF-TOKEN which contains your Roblox token.

you should replace "YOUR_USERNAME" and "YOUR_PASSWORD" with your own Roblox account credentials, and that you should never share your Roblox token with anyone.
